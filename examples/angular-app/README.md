# Angular demo

This project mirrors a fresh Angular CLI standalone app and wires the voice assistant in `AppComponent`
after the view initialises. It demonstrates how to manage the plugin lifecycle alongside Angular's
own component lifecycle hooks.

## Getting started

```bash
cd examples/angular-app
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and focus the textarea to summon the overlay.
Provide your API credentials via the assistant's settings panel to start making AI calls without
modifying the application code.
