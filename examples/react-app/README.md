# React demo

This example bootstraps the plugin inside a minimal Vite + React application. It shows how you can
instantiate `VoiceAssistPlugin` when the app mounts and clean it up when the component unmounts.

## Getting started

```bash
cd examples/react-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed URL (defaults to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)) and focus the
textarea. Use the gear icon in the assistant overlay to provide an API key or swap AI models without
redeploying.
